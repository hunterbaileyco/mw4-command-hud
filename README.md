# command-hud

Static, phone-first status page served from `docs/` on GitHub Pages.

- The data feed (`status.json`) is an **encrypted envelope**: `{ v, alg: "AES-GCM", kdf: "PBKDF2-SHA256", iter, salt, iv, ct }`.
  The page derives an AES-256-GCM key in the browser with PBKDF2-SHA256 from the access code and decrypts locally (Web Crypto). No readable data is published.
- `tools/build-status.mjs` builds the cleartext model off-repo, diffs it against the previous snapshot (deploy / rtb / hold / cleared events, ~6 h retained), and encrypts it.
- `tools/mw4crypto.js` is a dependency-free PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM decryptor used by the iOS Scriptable widgets (`scriptable/`), assembled by `tools/build-scriptable.mjs`.
